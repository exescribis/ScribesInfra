    ADefinedTerm
        avec sa definition


The `ADefinedTerm` is defined in the glossary. This just create a reference to the term.

By contrast `AnUndefinedTerm` is not defined. This create an entry in the list of undefined terms.
There is only one entry per term. So an other occurrence of `AnUndefinedTerm` will not generate
a new entry.

All undefined terms are in the :download:`.infra/docs/problems/missing-xrefs.rst` file.

An example of :py:func:`UnknownFunction`.
